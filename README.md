# Improved online DMP spatial generalization and incorporation of dynamic via-points

This package contains the source code used in the simulations and experiments of the paper "**Efficient DMP generalization to time-varying targets, external signals and via-points**" (under review)

- For the simulations, see the instructions in `simulations/README.md`
- For the experiments,  see the instructions in `experiments/README.md`
